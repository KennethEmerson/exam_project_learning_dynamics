# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: An Approach Based on the Other Agent's Internal Model

## Description
Exam project for the ULB/VUB course learning_dynamics

## Usage
### Run games and plot results
Centralized Q-learning method vs multi-agent Q-learning method with action estimation:
```python
simulation_figure_5.py
```
Two hunters have reward functions different from each other:
```python
simulation_figure_6.py
```
Proposed multi-agent Q-learning method vs Multi-agent Q-learning method with the action estimation based on self-model:
```python
simulation_figure_7.py
```
Proposed multi-agent Q-learning method vs Multi-agent Q-learning method with the action estimation based on self-model:
```python
simulation_figure_8.py
```
### Utils
Run custom simulation(creates .bin and .csv files with game results): 
```python
simulation.py
```
Plot simulation results(from .bin or .csv): 
```python
plot.py
```
Show players animation:
```python
animation.py
```
